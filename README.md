# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
import numpy as np
### Step 2: 
get the values from the users
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.jpg)
### Step 4: 
execute the programs using the formulae
### Step 5: 
end the program
### PROGRAM:
```python

import math 
l1= [4,2]
l2= [10,6]
distance = math.sqrt(((l2[0]-l1[0])**2)+((l2[1]-l1[1])**2))
print("{:.2f}".format(distance))
```
